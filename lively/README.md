# Lively Wallpaper Extra files

This directory contains custom files for using "AudiOrbits" as a Lively Wallpaper.

## About

[Lively Wallpaper](https://github.com/rocksdanister/lively) is a "FOSS" alternative to Wallpaper Engine.

Its pretty similar in its workings, except for [some small differences](https://github.com/rocksdanister/lively/wiki/Web-Guide-IV-:-Interaction).

## Instructions

1. Run Makebuild.ps1
2. Drag & Drop the resulting `.zip` file into Lively Wallpaper.
3. Enjoy

## Issues

If you have any issues, unfortunately I currently cannot give you much support.

Maybe Lively Wallpaper API has changed in the Meantime..

If you develop a fix and open a PR, I will gladly merge it.
