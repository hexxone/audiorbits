## A web wallpaper designed for [Wallpaper Engine](https://steamcommunity.com/app/431960)

## [THIS](https://github.com/hexxone/audiorbits) is the wallpaper's public git repository

## About

The Wallpaper is made for and maintained on the **Steam Workshop**.
It is however basically a website and can easily run in _most_ browsers.

_Note_: Chrome-based browsers are preferred. Firefox may have some smaller problems.

**Please address any [Issues](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/1396475780/1744478429683052516/) and [Ideas](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/1396475780/1744478429683052516/) on Steam.**

-   Git, NodeJs and NPM
-   yarn package manager (`npm install -g yarn`)

Install steps:

3. `yarn install`
4. `yarn dbg` on Unix or `yarn dbg-win` on Windows

## The little things

Certain HTML/JS/WebAssembly features need a secure web context to mitigate security risks.
[For example, this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SharedArrayBuffer#security_requirements)

Therefore this web-app needs to be served with the following html headers:

```
 'https': true,
 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*',
 'Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy': 'same-origin',
 'Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy': 'require-corp',
```

-> See webpack.config.js -> devServer
