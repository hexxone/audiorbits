[h1]Settings Guide[/h1]

As mentioned in the description, the Wallpaper takes quite some resources to run.

Here I will give a little insight behind the settings and what you can do to optimize performance and looks.

Keep in mind that a lot of the settings depend entirely on:
- your PC / hardware / screen resolution
- taste / type of music you listen to
- audio volume
- your own preference

So, take your time to play around, there are a lot of settings :)


[h2]How it works:[/h2]

Everything you see is made of a single base texture called a "Point".
Many Points are grouped together in a 2D fractal "Subset".
Multiple Subsets come together as a "Level".
And multiple Levels will become an orbit ;)

Points are processed using the "Hopalong Attractor" in the beginning and when a level passes the camera.

The audio-spectrum is analyzed and mapped in realtime.
It works by manipulating the movement, hue, saturation, light and size of subsets.


[h2]Wallpaper is not reacting to audio?[/h2]

Check you Wallpaper Engine Audio Settings:
First, check the correct input/output device in Wallpaper Engine Settings (default)
Next, confirm your input volume (mine is set to 100)

If this does not help, take a look at your Windows Audio Devices or the Wallpaper Engine official forum.
I can only help with issues related to this wallpaper, not necessarily your PC ://
