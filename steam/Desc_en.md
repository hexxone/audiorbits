This wallpaper uses WebGL, WebAudio and a fractal algorithm for "orbit" generation. It responds to music by projecting the audio spectrum in terms of color, saturation, and brightness onto the orbits.

[h1]🧬 Usage 🧬[/h1]
Right now, the wallpaper looks best with music that has some bass in it.
However, you can customize it perfectly to your preference with over 50 settings!
